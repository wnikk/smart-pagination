# Smart Pagination for Laravel

SmartPagination is a Laravel Blade component that simplifies pagination rendering and adds support
for reverse pagination (descending page numbers).
Itâ€™s designed to be flexible, SEO-friendly, and easy to customize.

Designed for blogs, news feeds, and any content that grows over time.


## Features
- Reverse page numbering: newest content on `?page=88`, oldest on `?page=1`
- Stable links: `?page=1` always points to the oldest page
- SEO-friendly canonical URLs
- Preserves all other query parameters
- Blade component with Bootstrap-ready markup

## Installation
Install via Composer:
```bash
composer require wnikk/smart-pagination
```


## Usage

```php
$posts = \App\Models\Post::orderByDesc('created_at')->paginate(10);

```
In your Blade view (SEO-links):
